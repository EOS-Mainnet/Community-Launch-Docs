## EOS Community,

Thank you for your time and consideration in crafting the EOS Mainnet Governance documentation over the course of the last 6 months. Input has been heard and incorporated from hundreds of independent contributors. 

We now have consent and adoption signaled by the following Block Producer Candidates; including, but not limited to: 

- Bitspace
- Blockgenic
- Cryptolions
- EOS 42
- EOS Argentina
- EOS Asia
- EOS Cafe/Calgary
- EOS Canada 
- eosDAC
- EOS Detroit
- EOS Dublin
- EOSMeso
- EOS Nation
- EOS New York
- EOS NodeOne
- EOSREAL
- EOSYS
- GenerEOS
- sw/eden 

to move forward with the proposed Constitution and accompanying governing documents found here: https://github.com/EOS-Mainnet/Community-Launch-Docs. For the time being, the repository will be managed by David Moss, John Milburn, and Sam Sapoznick.

This interim Constitution will be up for revision and referendum within 90 days, or as soon as the Referendum Contracts are in place, allowing for on-chain voting. By the end of 2018 we plan to put all major points of discussion up for a formal vote by the community.

**Reason for Changes**

Aside from us believing in these changes, we also received a strong signal from Block.one that it was necessary for the community to modify the Constitution and to make this the communities’ blockchain.

**Summary of Changes**

1. Article 1 (non-violence) is being amended to allow prosecution of non-violent crimes like fraud. Yesterday’s consensus involved simply adding the word “unlawful violence”.  This version is clearer and less prone to misinterpretation. The Article now reads:


Article I - No Initiation of Violence
Members shall not initiate violence or the threat of violence against another Member. Lawful prosecution of crimes with the goal of preserving life, liberty and property does not constitute initiation of violence.

2. Changing the name of the token from SYS to EOS.

3. Removing from the transfer contract these two requirements:

 I know the person(s) who transferred {{quantity}} to '{{from}}'.
 I know the owner(s) of the '{{to}}' account.

Change:
https://github.com/EOS-Mainnet/Community-Launch-Docs/commit/4475094864637febed29154b2391e92384427bb6#diff-875896b343c7fda4e4221743780fa8f7 

While these may be a good idea, enough community members voiced concerns that we want to put it up for a formal referendum. It is also likely that Block.one developed a super-compliant default setting that goes beyond the preferences of the community.

4. Finally, there was imprecise language in the Block Producer Agreement regarding disclosure of ownership. As stated, the original language would have required onerous disclosure of beneficial (indirect) owners of a Block Producer. The new draft requires ALL direct owners to be disclosed. It also requires all beneficial (indirect) owners who own 10% or more to disclose ownership. The section now reads:

I, {{producer}}, hereby agree to disclose and attest under penalty of perjury all ultimate beneficial owners of my company who own more than 10% and all direct shareholders.

# Call to Action

Critical referendum can happen in 90 days, or as soon as the Referendum Contracts are in place, and formal proposals in 180 days for this interim Constitution.


Block Producers involved in the launch should adopt these documents as the ones with broadest community consent.

Block Producers, please announce the following on all social media platforms:
